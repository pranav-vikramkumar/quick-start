//==========================================
//			Terminology
//==========================================

Client is the application that is making the request on behalf of the user. 
Eg) Browser, App etc

User is the user who wishes to be authenticated. 
Eg) The human user trying to login

Authority: It just means permission. The user can define his own authorities.
Eg) Homepage_view, add_friend

Role: It is also an authority. Just a specialized authority. It starts with ROLE_ prefix. Here also the user can name it whatever he wants.
Eg) ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER

Scope: 
Just like Users have authorities, scope is the authority of the Client
Eg) This is also user defined like “Share_post_to_instagram”

//==========================================
//			Authorization Server
//==========================================
Authorization Server is running on port 8081
Header passes the Client information
The Body passes the user information

1.	The “Token” Endpoint to get an access token
	http://localhost:8081/oauth/token
	Headers: 
		Basic ZmFjZWJvb2tfYXBwOnNlY3JldA== 
	
	•	This above is base64 of “facebook_app:secret” (which is the client’s id and secret)
	•	Obviously, the token endpoint must be open to everyone without authentication. Hence the permitAll() in AuthServerConfiguration.java
	•	Also note that the client details like authorities, token duration etc are also configured in AuthServerConfiguration.java
	•	User details like password and roles are present in the UserDetailsService.java

	Body (User’s credentials)
	{
		“grant_type”:”password”,
		“username”:”admin”,
		“password”:”password”
	}

	Response
	{
		"access_token": "eba6daa6-78df-4790-bf01-685664850ff4",
		"token_type": "bearer",
		"refresh_token": "7ac7b4e5-9ad3-4260-942d-b1d6124c2b84",
		"expires_in": 1199,
		"scope": "get_token access_to_facebook"
	}

2.	The “Check Token” Endpoint is used by the resource server to check whether the access token given to it is valid and get the details of the user like what all roles he has.
	Ideally, we don’t need to hit this endpoint as it is done internally.
	But to debug, this endpoint can be helpful.
